# ToF Mass Calibration Classification

This repository contains code for cleaning ToF Data and using it to train models
for classifying ToF spectra as well calibrated or poorly calibrated.

I work mostly in jupyter notebooks but whenever I write a function, I try to generalize
it and add it to a python script to save time in the future.

Data is too large to provide here, provided upon request.

Data is created in /notebooks/ToFDataPreparation.ipynb
